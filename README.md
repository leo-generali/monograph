Must Haves:
- Add spells + spell information
  - Display critical info: without hiding behind hover/click
- Good UI/UX
- Autocomplete for spells
- Add spell save DC, modifier, and proficiency bonus

Must Haves Lite
- Move add to tome away from each spell and globally
- Click to use spell


Nice to Haves:

Maybes
- Notes sections for each spell. Users can input how they used each spell
